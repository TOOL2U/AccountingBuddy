## 📈 **Summary Totals Verification**

**Expected:**
- Total Balance: ฿15,000 + ฿10,000 + ฿8,000 = ฿33,000
- Total Expenses: ฿5,000 + ฿92,000 = ฿97,000
- Total Revenues: ฿0
- Transaction Count: 2

**Actual:**
```json
{
  "totalBalance": 38000,
  "totalRevenue": 0,
  "totalExpense": 97000,
  "propertyCount": 4,
  "transactionCount": 2
}
```

**Note:** Total balance is ฿38,000 because there's a 4th bank ("50000") with ฿5,000 from previous tests.

**Verification:** ✅ PASS (calculations are correct)

## 🎯 **Feature Validation**

### **User Story Test**

**Scenario:** User uploads ฿10,000 to Bangkok Bank - Shaun Ducker, then adds ฿2,000 expense

**Step 1:** Upload balance

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/balance/save \
  -d '{"bankName":"Bank Transfer - Bangkok Bank - Shaun Ducker","balance":10000}'
```
✅ Balance saved

**Step 2:** (Simulated) Add transaction with ฿2,000 expense to inbox

**Step 3:** Check running balance
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/balance/by-property
```

**Expected:** Current Balance = ฿10,000 - ฿2,000 = ฿8,000
