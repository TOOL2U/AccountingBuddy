## Google Sheets Setup

### Required Named Ranges

Create these named ranges in your Google Sheet:

1. **`AI_Prompts`**
   - Single cell containing the AI extraction prompt
   - Example: Cell `Z1` on a "Config" sheet

2. **`AI_KeywordRules`**
   - Range with 3 columns: `keyword`, `category`, `priority`
   - Example: `AA1:AC100` on a "Config" sheet
   - Header row: `keyword | category | priority`

### Apps Script Functions

Add these functions to your Apps Script (see `COMPLETE_APPS_SCRIPT_V6_FINAL.js`):

```javascript
function handleGetPrompt() {
  // Read from AI_Prompts named range
  // Return { ok: true, prompt: "...", lastUpdated: "..." }
}

function handleUpdatePrompt(prompt) {
  // Write to AI_Prompts named range
  // Return { ok: true }
}

function handleGetRules() {
  // Read from AI_KeywordRules named range
  // Return { ok: true, rules: [...] }
}

function handleUpdateRules(rules) {
  // Write to AI_KeywordRules named range
  // Return { ok: true }
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Prompts not loading
- Check that `AI_Prompts` named range exists in Google Sheets
- Verify Apps Script has `handleGetPrompt()` function
- Check browser console for errors

### Rules not saving
- Check that `AI_KeywordRules` named range exists
- Verify Apps Script has `handleUpdateRules()` function
- Ensure rules have valid keyword, category, and priority

### Test console errors
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in environment variables
- Check that the prompt is valid (not empty)
- Review error logs in the **Live Logs** tab

### Logs not appearing
- Logs are in-memory only and clear on restart
- Check that auto-refresh is enabled
- Verify filter is set to correct event type

## Best Practices

1. **Test before deploying:** Always test prompt and rule changes in the Test Console before saving
2. **Monitor logs:** Keep the Live Logs tab open while testing to catch issues early
3. **Backup prompts:** Copy your prompt to a text file before making major changes
4. **Use priorities:** Set higher priorities for more specific keywords
5. **Regular review:** Check logs weekly to identify patterns and improve accuracy

---

## Security Notes

- The AI section is protected by the same PIN as the main admin page
- Prompts and rules are stored in Google Sheets (not in the database)
- Logs are in-memory only and never stored permanently
- Test console does not save data to Google Sheets
- All API calls are logged for monitoring
