## 📊 **Performance Analysis**

### **Response Times - All Within Acceptable Range**

| Operation Type | Average Time | Assessment |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| **Google Sheets Read** | 5-7 seconds | ✅ Normal (Apps Script) |
| **Google Sheets Write** | 5-7 seconds | ✅ Normal (Apps Script) |
| **AI Processing (OpenAI)** | 2-3 seconds | ✅ Excellent |
| **OCR (Google Vision)** | TBD | ⏳ Test in Phase 2 |

**Note:** Google Sheets operations are inherently slower due to:
1. Apps Script execution time
2. Data fetching from Google Sheets
3. Data processing and formatting
4. Response serialization

**This is expected and acceptable.** ✅

---

## 🔍 **What We Learned**

### **Custom Domain Configuration**

**The Fix:**
- Switched from `accounting-buddy-app.vercel.app` to `accounting.siamoon.com`
- All environment variables already configured correctly ✅
- All Apps Script webhooks working ✅
- All authentication working ✅

**Why It Works Now:**
1. ✅ Custom domain points to same Vercel deployment
2. ✅ All environment variables are environment-agnostic
3. ✅ Apps Script webhook URL is absolute (not domain-dependent)
4. ✅ Authentication secret matches on both sides

---

## ✅ **Environment Variables - All Configured**

### **Current Vercel Production Configuration:**

```env
# Google Cloud APIs
GOOGLE_VISION_KEY=✅ Configured (48m ago)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=✅ Configured (48m ago)
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=✅ Configured (48m ago)

# OpenAI API
