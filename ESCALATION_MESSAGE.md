Subject: üö® ESCALATION: Google Sheets Webhook Authentication Failure - Accounting Buddy

Hi Lead Engineer,

I'm escalating a technical issue with the Accounting Buddy application that requires your expertise. After extensive troubleshooting, I've hit a wall with Google Apps Script webhook authentication.

## üî• URGENT ISSUE SUMMARY

**Problem:** Google Apps Script webhook consistently returns "Unauthorized" responses, blocking the core functionality of saving receipt data to Google Sheets.

**Impact:** 
- Users cannot complete the receipt processing workflow
- All other components (OCR, AI extraction, frontend) are working perfectly
- Application is 95% functional but missing the final critical step

**Status:** All standard troubleshooting approaches exhausted

## üìã WHAT I'VE TRIED

1. **Three different authentication methods:**
   - Query parameter with raw secret
   - URL-encoded query parameter  
   - Authorization Bearer header (current)

2. **Multiple Apps Script deployments** with different configurations

3. **Direct API testing** with cURL - all fail with same "Unauthorized" response

4. **Environment verification** - all variables correctly configured

## üéØ WHERE I NEED YOUR HELP

This appears to be a **Google Apps Script deployment/configuration issue** rather than a code problem. The Next.js side is working flawlessly - it's receiving data, validating it, and sending properly formatted requests.

**Specific areas to investigate:**
1. **Apps Script deployment settings** - execution permissions, access levels
2. **Google Cloud Platform restrictions** - potential service limitations
3. **Alternative integration approaches** - if current method has fundamental incompatibilities

## üìÅ DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED

I've created a comprehensive technical report with all findings:
**File:** `/WEBHOOK_TROUBLESHOOTING_REPORT.md`

**Contains:**
- Complete troubleshooting timeline
- All code changes documented
- Evidence from server logs
- Recommended next steps
- Debug strategies

## üöÄ CURRENT APPLICATION STATUS

**Working Components:**
‚úÖ Google Vision OCR - Extracting text from receipts  
‚úÖ OpenAI AI - Processing and structuring data  
‚úÖ Next.js frontend - Complete user workflow  
‚úÖ All environment configuration  

**Blocked Component:**
‚ùå Google Sheets integration - Authentication failure

**Dev Server:** Running on http://localhost:3002 for testing

## ‚è∞ URGENCY

This is the last remaining blocker for a fully functional receipt processing application. The technical foundation is solid, but we need to resolve this Google Apps Script integration to deliver the complete solution.

Your expertise with Google Cloud services and enterprise integrations would be invaluable in resolving this quickly.

## ü§ù HANDOFF DETAILS

- **Environment:** All set up and ready for testing
- **Documentation:** Complete technical report available
- **Code State:** All changes documented, easily reversible
- **Testing:** Can be tested immediately at localhost:3002

Ready to provide any additional information or clarification you need.

Thanks for taking this on!

Best regards,
