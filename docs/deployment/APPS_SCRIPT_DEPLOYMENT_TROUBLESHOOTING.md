# üö® Apps Script Deployment Troubleshooting

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Issue:** Apps Script returns "Moved Temporarily" redirect and then "File not found" error  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPLOYMENT ISSUE DETECTED**

---

## üîç Problem Detected

When testing the Apps Script webhook URL, we get:

```
HTTP 302 Moved Temporarily
‚Üí Redirects to Google Drive error page
‚Üí "‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏†‡∏±‡∏¢ ‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ñ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏î‡πÑ‡∏ü‡∏•‡πå‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡πÉ‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πâ" (Sorry, cannot open file at this time)
```

**This means:** The deployment is not properly configured or the URL is incorrect.

---

## üéØ Root Cause

This error typically happens when:

1. ‚ùå **Deployment is not set to "Anyone"** - The deployment is restricted
2. ‚ùå **Deployment URL is old/invalid** - The deployment was deleted or changed
3. ‚ùå **Deployment is not published** - The script is saved but not deployed
4. ‚ùå **Wrong deployment type** - Using "Test deployment" instead of "New deployment"

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Redeploy Apps Script Correctly

### **Step 1: Open Apps Script Editor**

1. Open your Google Sheet: **"Accounting Buddy P&L 2025"**
2. Click **Extensions** ‚Üí **Apps Script**
3. You should see your code with `EXPECTED_SECRET` on line 38

---

### **Step 2: Verify the Code**

Make sure line 38 shows:
```javascript
const EXPECTED_SECRET = "VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8=";
```

If it doesn't match, copy the entire `COMPLETE_APPS_SCRIPT_V7_WITH_BALANCE.js` file and paste it.

---

### **Step 3: Delete Old Deployment (Important!)**

1. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí **Manage deployments**
2. You'll see your current deployment(s)
3. Click the **trash icon** (üóëÔ∏è) next to the old deployment
4. Confirm deletion
5. Click **Close**

---

### **Step 4: Create NEW Deployment**

1. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí **New deployment**
2. Click the **gear icon** (‚öôÔ∏è) next to "Select type"
3. Select **"Web app"**
4. Configure the deployment:
   - **Description:** `V8 - Fixed authentication and named ranges`
   - **Execute as:** `Me (your-email@gmail.com)`
   - **Who has access:** **"Anyone"** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL - Must be "Anyone"**
5. Click **Deploy**
6. You may need to authorize the script:
   - Click **Authorize access**
   - Select your Google account
   - Click **Advanced** ‚Üí **Go to [Project Name] (unsafe)**
   - Click **Allow**
7. **Copy the new Web app URL** - It should look like:
   ```
   https://script.google.com/macros/s/[DEPLOYMENT_ID]/exec
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Update Environment Variables**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** The new deployment will have a **DIFFERENT URL**!

You need to update these environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard** ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
2. Update these variables with the **NEW URL**:
   - `SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - `SHEETS_PNL_URL`
   - `SHEETS_BALANCES_GET_URL`
   - `SHEETS_BALANCES_APPEND_URL`

3. All 4 should point to the **SAME NEW URL**

4. Click **Save**

5. **Redeploy your Vercel app:**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click the **...** menu on the latest deployment
   - Click **Redeploy**

---

### **Step 6: Update .env.local**

Update your local `.env.local` file with the new URL:

```bash
SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/[NEW_DEPLOYMENT_ID]/exec
SHEETS_PNL_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/[NEW_DEPLOYMENT_ID]/exec
SHEETS_BALANCES_GET_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/[NEW_DEPLOYMENT_ID]/exec
SHEETS_BALANCES_APPEND_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/[NEW_DEPLOYMENT_ID]/exec
```

---

### **Step 7: Test the New Deployment**

Test directly with the **NEW URL**:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://script.google.com/macros/s/[NEW_DEPLOYMENT_ID]/exec" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"getPnL","secret":"VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8="}'
```

**Expected result:** JSON data with P&L metrics

**If you still get "Unauthorized":** The code in Apps Script doesn't match the file

**If you get HTML error:** The deployment access is not set to "Anyone"

---

## üîß Alternative: Update Existing Deployment

If you don't want to change the URL, you can update the existing deployment:

### **Step 1: Manage Deployments**

1. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí **Manage deployments**
2. Click the **pencil icon** (‚úèÔ∏è Edit) next to your deployment

### **Step 2: Check Access Settings**

1. Verify **"Who has access"** is set to **"Anyone"**
2. If it's not, change it to **"Anyone"**
3. Under **Version**, select **"New version"**
4. Description: `V8 - Fixed authentication`
5. Click **Deploy**

### **Step 3: Test Again**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwRMGdzvsn3-3JhlUA8cVMeX5gySIJzTMJu1hywgPAT2_QiVKj-3KJfFScHhDQwFtKC/exec" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"getPnL","secret":"VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8="}'
```
