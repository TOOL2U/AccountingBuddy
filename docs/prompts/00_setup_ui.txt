# 00_setup_ui.txt — Phase 1: UI Scaffold Build

## Objective
Create the complete frontend UI for Accounting Buddy using Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

Focus: static mock data, responsive layout, no backend or API integration yet.

## Requirements

### Pages
1. `/upload`
   - Drag-and-drop + "Choose File" upload section
   - File preview thumbnail (mock image)
   - "Process" button (mock alert for now)
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, PDF
   - Clean grayscale theme with blue accent
   - Centered, minimal layout

2. `/review/[id]`
   - Four fields: Date, Vendor, Amount, Category
   - Pre-filled with mock data
   - Editable form, "Send to Google Sheet" button (mock alert)
   - Success toast placeholder (hidden by default)

3. `/inbox`
   - Simple table of mock receipts with name, status, and delete option
   - Status badges (green/yellow)
   - Back to Upload link

### Navigation
- Persistent top nav with links to Upload and Inbox
- Responsive (stack on small screens)
- Add placeholder logo/title "Accounting Buddy"

### Design
- Font: Inter
- Color: grayscale + blue accent (#3B82F6)
- Rounded buttons, modern minimal aesthetic
- Mobile-friendly layouts (`sm:` breakpoint)
- Mock data only — no API calls yet

### Acceptance Criteria
✅ All pages render correctly under `/upload`, `/review/[id]`, `/inbox`  
✅ Navigation works across pages  
✅ Buttons and inputs are styled with Tailwind  
✅ Layout is responsive and consistent  
✅ No backend or API logic included yet  

### After Build
After completion, confirm by testing:
- Run `npm run dev`
- Visit `/upload`, `/review/1`, `/inbox`
- Verify all buttons trigger alerts instead of real logic
