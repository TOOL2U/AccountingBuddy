# 🔧 Remove Library Dependency from Apps Script

**URGENT:** Your Apps Script has a library dependency that's causing all requests to fail.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Every request shows: `lib=MO6Ijj8BZGUsFaBoVLJuezIFpGDg2vV9V`

This library ID is causing the redirect to fail with "File not found" error.

---

## ✅ How to Remove the Library

### **Step 1: Open Apps Script**

1. Go to your Google Sheet: **"Accounting Buddy P&L 2025"**
2. Click **Extensions** → **Apps Script**

---

### **Step 2: Check for Libraries**

Look at the **left sidebar**. You should see:
- 📄 Files
- ⚙️ Services  
- 📚 **Libraries** ← **LOOK FOR THIS**

---

### **Step 3: Remove the Library**

#### **Option A: If you see "Libraries" section**

1. Click on **Libraries** in the left sidebar
2. You'll see a list of libraries (probably one library)
3. Click the **trash icon** (🗑️) or **X** next to the library
4. Confirm removal
5. Click **Save** (💾)

#### **Option B: If you see a "+" icon next to Libraries**

1. The library might be hidden
2. Click the **+** icon next to "Libraries"
3. You'll see a list of added libraries
4. Click **Remove** or the **X** next to each library
5. Click **Save** (💾)

#### **Option C: Check Project Settings**

1. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) in the left sidebar (Project Settings)
2. Scroll down to see if there are any library dependencies listed
3. Remove any libraries you find

---

### **Step 4: Verify No Libraries**

After removing libraries:

1. The "Libraries" section should be **empty** or show "No libraries added"
2. Click **Save** (💾) to save the project

---

### **Step 5: Deploy Again**

1. Click **Deploy** → **Manage deployments**
2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) next to your deployment
3. Under **Version**, select **"New version"**
4. Description: `V8 - Removed library dependency`
5. Click **Deploy**

**NOTE:** The URL should stay the same this time:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz5XaBrHt7uxWHYN_Oy3hJNxGeHDnhMss4-sW1ZSNNGNITl11NlNqb7SDCvxT30vqEb/exec
```

---

### **Step 6: Test**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz5XaBrHt7uxWHYN_Oy3hJNxGeHDnhMss4-sW1ZSNNGNITl11NlNqb7SDCvxT30vqEb/exec" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"getPnL","secret":"VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8="}'
```

**Expected:** JSON data (NO redirect, NO HTML)

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### **In the Left Sidebar:**

```
📁 Files
  └─ Code.gs (or your script file)
⚙️ Services
  └─ (any Google services you've added)
📚 Libraries  ← **THIS SHOULD BE EMPTY**
  └─ ❌ NO LIBRARIES SHOULD BE HERE
```

---

## 🎯 Alternative: Create New Apps Script Project

If you can't find or remove the library, create a completely new Apps Script project:

### **Step 1: Create New Project**

1. In your Google Sheet, click **Extensions** → **Apps Script**
2. Click **File** → **New** → **Script**
3. Or create a new standalone Apps Script project

### **Step 2: Copy Code**

1. **SELECT ALL** in the new project (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A)
2. **DELETE** everything
3. **COPY** the entire `COMPLETE_APPS_SCRIPT_V7_WITH_BALANCE.js` file
4. **PASTE** into the new project
5. Click **Save** (💾)

### **Step 3: Deploy**

1. Click **Deploy** → **New deployment**
2. Select **"Web app"**
3. Configure:
   - **Execute as:** Me
   - **Who has access:** Anyone
4. Click **Deploy**
5. **Copy the new URL**

### **Step 4: Update Environment Variables**

Update `.env.local` and Vercel with the new URL.
