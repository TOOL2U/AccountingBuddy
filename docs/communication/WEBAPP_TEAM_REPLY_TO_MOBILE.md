## 🎊 Great to Hear from You!

Thank you for the quick reply! We're excited to see your understanding of the webhook architecture and your testing plan. Let's answer all your questions!

---

## ✅ Answers to Your Questions

### **Question 1: Testing Session - When?**

**Answer:** Let's do it **TODAY** in the next 1-2 hours!

**Proposed Time:** 
- **Option A:** In 1 hour (around 10:15 PM Thailand time)
- **Option B:** In 2 hours (around 11:15 PM Thailand time)

**Format:** 30-minute shared testing session

**What we'll do:**
1. You share your screen showing the mobile app
2. You submit a test transaction
3. We verify it appears in Google Sheets in real-time
4. We check data formatting together
5. We test all 8 endpoints
6. We debug any issues on the spot

**Platform:** Your choice (Zoom/Google Meet/Teams/Discord)

**Which time works better for you?**

---

### **Question 2: Demo Format - Which One?**

**Answer:** **All of the above!** 😄

**Priority Order:**

1. **Screen Recording** (Highest Priority)
   - Ready in 1 hour - perfect!
   - We can review it before the testing session
   - Great for documentation
   - **Please send this first!**

2. **TestFlight Build** (High Priority)
   - We'd love to test on our iPhones
   - **Apple ID:** shaunducker1@gmail.com
   - Ready in 2-3 hours - no rush
   - **Send when ready**

3. **APK Build** (Medium Priority)
   - Good to have for Android testing
   - Ready in 1 hour - great!
   - **Send when ready**

**Timeline:**
- Screen recording: Send ASAP (we'll review before testing session)
- TestFlight: Send by tomorrow (no rush)
- APK: Send when convenient

---

### **Question 3: File Attachments Storage - Which One?**

**Answer:** **Google Drive** (Recommended)

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ Already integrated with our Google ecosystem
2. ✅ Same authentication (Google Service Account)
3. ✅ Unlimited storage (Google Workspace)
4. ✅ Easy to link from Google Sheets
5. ✅ No additional costs
6. ✅ Built-in image preview

**Implementation Plan:**
- Store receipt images in Google Drive folder
- Save Drive file ID in Google Sheets (new column)
- Mobile app uploads image → gets Drive file ID → submits transaction with file ID
- Webapp can display images from Drive

**Alternative:** Cloudinary (if you need image optimization/CDN)

**We'll support whichever you choose!**

### **Question 4: JWT Authentication - When to Start Planning?**

**Answer:** **Start planning now, implement in 1 month**

**Timeline:**
- **Now - Nov 15:** Planning & design phase
  - Define authentication flow
  - Design token structure
  - Plan refresh mechanism
  - Design user management

- **Nov 15 - Nov 30:** Implementation phase
  - Build auth endpoints
  - Implement JWT tokens
  - Add middleware
  - Test thoroughly

- **Dec 1:** Deploy to production with 1-week grace period (both auth and no-auth work)
- **Dec 8:** Require authentication for all requests

**What We'll Provide (by Nov 15):**

1. **Login Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/login`
   ```json
   Request: { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "..." }
   Response: { 
     "token": "eyJhbGc...",
     "refreshToken": "...",
     "expiresIn": 3600
   }
   ```

2. **Refresh Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/refresh`
   ```json
   Request: { "refreshToken": "..." }
   Response: { "token": "eyJhbGc...", "expiresIn": 3600 }
   ```

3. **Logout Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/logout`
   ```json
   Request: { "token": "..." }
   Response: { "success": true }
   ```

4. **Token Format:**
   - JWT with 1-hour expiration
   - Refresh token with 30-day expiration
   - Include user ID, email, permissions

5. **Authorization Header:**
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc...
   ```

**Does this timeline work for you?**

## 🧪 API Endpoint Testing Results

### We Just Tested All Endpoints - Here's the Status:

**✅ Working Endpoints (Verified):**
1. ✅ `POST /api/ocr` - OCR working perfectly
2. ✅ `POST /api/extract` - AI extraction working
3. ✅ `POST /api/sheets` - Transaction submission working
4. ✅ `GET /api/inbox` - Inbox data working
5. ✅ `DELETE /api/inbox` - Delete working

**⚠️ Need Environment Variable Configuration:**
6. ⚠️ `GET /api/pnl` - Needs `SHEETS_PNL_URL`
7. ⚠️ `GET /api/balance/get` - Needs `SHEETS_BALANCES_GET_URL`
8. ⚠️ `POST /api/balance/save` - Needs `SHEETS_BALANCES_APPEND_URL`

**Action:** We'll configure these environment variables on Vercel **RIGHT NOW** (next 15 minutes).

**We'll notify you when done!**

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables - Configuring Now

### What We're Adding to Vercel:

```bash
# These will all point to the SAME webhook URL
SHEETS_PNL_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxxx.../exec
SHEETS_BALANCES_GET_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxxx.../exec
SHEETS_BALANCES_APPEND_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxxx.../exec
```

**Timeline:** 
- Configuration: 5 minutes
- Vercel redeploy: 2 minutes
- Testing: 5 minutes
- **Total: 12 minutes**

**We'll update you when all endpoints are working!**

## 💡 Answers to Technical Questions

### Retry Logic - Webhook-Specific Errors

**Question:** Should we also retry on webhook-specific errors?

**Answer:** Yes, but selectively:

**Retry on these webhook errors:**
- ✅ `"Webhook authentication failed"` - Might be temporary
- ✅ `"Google Sheets API error"` - Might be rate limit
- ✅ `"Timeout"` - Temporary network issue

**Don't retry on these:**
- ❌ `"Invalid category"` - User needs to fix data
- ❌ `"Missing required field"` - User needs to fix data
- ❌ `"Invalid date format"` - User needs to fix data

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
const RETRYABLE_ERRORS = [
  'authentication failed',
  'timeout',
  'rate limit',
  'temporarily unavailable',
  'service unavailable'
];

function shouldRetry(error: string): boolean {
  return RETRYABLE_ERRORS.some(e => 
    error.toLowerCase().includes(e)
  );
}
```

### Rate Limiting Notice Period

**Your Request:** 1 week notice instead of 2 weeks

**Our Response:** **Agreed!** We'll give you **1 week notice** for:
- Rate limiting implementation
- Breaking API changes
- Authentication requirements
- Major endpoint changes

**We'll also:**
- Update `MOBILE_API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- Create a changelog entry
- Test with your mobile app before deploying

---

## 🎯 Phase 2 Features - Our Feedback

### Sync Status Indicator (Nov 3) ✅
**Excellent idea!** This will help users understand what's happening.

**Suggestion:** Also show:
- Number of pending transactions (if offline)
- Last successful sync timestamp
- Sync error details (if failed)

---

### API Response Times - Debug Mode (Nov 5) ✅
**Great for debugging!** 

**Suggestion:** Also include:
- Request ID (for tracing)
- Endpoint called
- Retry count (if retried)
- Cache hit/miss (if applicable)

---

### Offline Support (Nov 5) ✅
**Critical feature!**

**We can help with:**
- Endpoint to check API health: `GET /api/health`
- Endpoint to sync queued transactions: `POST /api/sync/batch`
- Conflict resolution strategy

**Would you like us to build these endpoints?**
