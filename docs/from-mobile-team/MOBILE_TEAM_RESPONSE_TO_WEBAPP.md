# 📱 Mobile Team Response - Understanding the Issue

**To:** Webapp Team & Project Manager  
**From:** Mobile App Team  
**Date:** October 30, 2025 - 9:50 PM  
**Subject:** Acknowledged - Apps Script Authentication Issue

---

## ✅ **We Understand the Issue Now!**

Thank you for the detailed status report! We now understand:

1. ✅ **Webapp backend is fully configured** (all 10 environment variables)
2. ✅ **Vercel has been redeployed** successfully
3. ✅ **The "Unauthorized" error is from Google Apps Script**, not from Next.js
4. ✅ **The webhook secret in Apps Script needs to be verified/updated**

**This makes perfect sense!**

---

## 🎯 **Mobile Team Action Plan**

### **Phase 1A: Test OCR & Extract Endpoints (NOW)**

As the webapp team suggested, we can test these 2 endpoints right now since they don't use Apps Script:

**Test 1: OCR Endpoint** ⏳
```bash
POST /api/ocr
Uses: Google Cloud Vision API (no Apps Script)
Status: Ready to test NOW
```

**Test 2: Extract Endpoint** ⏳
```bash
POST /api/extract
Uses: OpenAI API (no Apps Script)
Status: Ready to test NOW
```

**We'll test these immediately and report results!**

---

### **Phase 1B: Test Apps Script Endpoints (AFTER PM FIX)**

These 6 endpoints need Apps Script webhook to work:

**Test 3: Sheets Endpoint** ⏳
```bash
POST /api/sheets
Uses: Apps Script webhook
Status: Waiting for PM to fix Apps Script secret
```

**Test 4: Inbox GET** ⏳
```bash
GET /api/inbox
Uses: Apps Script webhook
Status: Waiting for PM to fix Apps Script secret
```

**Test 5: Inbox DELETE** ⏳
```bash
DELETE /api/inbox
Uses: Apps Script webhook
Status: Waiting for PM to fix Apps Script secret
```

**Test 6: P&L Endpoint** ⏳
```bash
GET /api/pnl
Uses: Apps Script webhook
Status: Waiting for PM to fix Apps Script secret
```

**Test 7: Balance GET** ⏳
```bash
GET /api/balance/get
Uses: Apps Script webhook
Status: Waiting for PM to fix Apps Script secret
```

**Test 8: Balance SAVE** ⏳
```bash
POST /api/balance/save
Uses: Apps Script webhook
Status: Waiting for PM to fix Apps Script secret
```

**We'll test these after PM fixes Apps Script!**

## 🧪 **Testing OCR & Extract Endpoints NOW**

Let me test the 2 endpoints that should work right now...

### **Test 1: OCR Endpoint**

**Testing:** Extracting text from a sample receipt image...

**Status:** ⏳ Testing in progress...

---

### **Test 2: Extract Endpoint**

**Testing:** AI field extraction from sample text...

**Status:** ⏳ Testing in progress...

---

## 📋 **Summary for PM**

### **Current Situation:**

**Webapp Backend:** ✅ Fully configured (all 10 environment variables)  
**Vercel Deployment:** ✅ Successful  
**Next.js API:** ✅ Working correctly  
**Google Apps Script:** ⚠️ Webhook secret needs verification  

### **Blocker:**

**Google Apps Script webhook authentication**
- The secret in Apps Script properties might not match Vercel
- OR Apps Script might not be deployed
- OR Apps Script might not have permissions

### **Who Can Fix:**

**You (PM)** - Only you have access to Google Apps Script

**What to do:**
1. Open Google Apps Script: https://script.google.com
2. Open "Accounting Buddy Webhook" project
3. Go to Project Settings → Script Properties
4. Verify `WEBHOOK_SECRET` = `VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8=`
5. If different, update it
6. Verify Apps Script is deployed as web app
7. Test with cURL command (webapp team provided)

**Timeline:** 10 minutes

---

## ⏱️ **Updated Timeline**

### **Now (Mobile Team):**
- Testing OCR endpoint (5 min)
- Testing Extract endpoint (5 min)
- Report results (5 min)
- **Total: 15 minutes**

### **After PM Fixes Apps Script:**
- Mobile team tests remaining 6 endpoints (15 min)
- Mobile team tests from mobile app (20 min)
- Mobile team tests error handling (10 min)
- Mobile team reports final results (5 min)
- **Total: 50 minutes**

### **Grand Total:**
- **65 minutes from when PM fixes Apps Script**

## 💡 **What We Learned**

### **Architecture Understanding:**

```
Mobile App → Next.js API (Vercel) → Google Apps Script → Google Sheets
            ✅ Working          ⚠️ Auth Issue      ✅ Working
```

**The issue is in the middle layer (Apps Script authentication).**

### **Why This Happened:**

1. Environment variables were missing in Vercel (fixed by webapp team)
2. Apps Script webhook secret might not match Vercel secret
3. This is a configuration issue, not a code issue

### **Why This is Good:**

1. ✅ Webapp backend is properly configured
2. ✅ Webapp team diagnosed the issue correctly
3. ✅ Solution is simple (update Apps Script secret)
4. ✅ No code changes needed
5. ✅ We can test 2 endpoints right now (OCR, Extract)

---

## 🎯 **Mobile Team Commitments**

### **We Commit To:**

1. ✅ Test OCR & Extract endpoints immediately (next 15 min)
2. ✅ Report results to webapp team and PM
3. ✅ Wait for PM to fix Apps Script secret
4. ✅ Test remaining 6 endpoints after fix (15 min)
5. ✅ Test from mobile app (20 min)
6. ✅ Test error handling (10 min)
7. ✅ Provide comprehensive final report (5 min)

### **We Are Ready:**

- ✅ Mobile app code is ready
- ✅ Testing plan is ready
- ✅ We understand the architecture
- ✅ We know what to test and when
