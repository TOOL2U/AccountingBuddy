## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Request Format

**Example: Submit Transaction**
```json
POST /api/sheets
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "day": "30",
  "month": "10",
  "year": "2025",
  "property": "Alesia House",
  "typeOfOperation": "EXP - Construction - Structure",
  "typeOfPayment": "Bank Transfer - Bangkok Bank - Shaun Ducker",
  "detail": "Building materials",
  "ref": "INV-12345",
  "debit": 15000,
  "credit": 0
}
```

**Example: OCR Request**
```json
POST /api/ocr
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
}
```

---

### Retry Logic Implemented

The mobile app includes automatic retry logic for reliability:

- **Retry Attempts:** 3 attempts
- **Retry Delay:** Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Retry Conditions:** HTTP 429, 500, 502, 503, 504
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds per request

This helps handle temporary network issues and server load.

---

### Error Handling

The mobile app gracefully handles all API error responses:

- ✅ Network errors → User-friendly message
- ✅ Validation errors → Specific field feedback
- ✅ Server errors → Retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ "Not configured" responses → Informative message

**Example error handling:**
```typescript
try {
  const response = await apiService.submitTransaction(data);
  if (response.success) {
    // Show success message
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Show user-friendly error message
  // Automatically retries 3 times before failing
}
```

---

## 🚨 Critical: Dropdown Values

### ✅ All Dropdown Values Corrected

The mobile app now uses the **exact** dropdown values from your Google Sheets backend:

**Properties (7 options):**
```
1. Sia Moon - Land - General
2. Alesia House
3. Lanna House
4. Parents House
5. Shaun Ducker - Personal
6. Maria Ren - Personal
7. Family
```

**Type of Operation (33 options):**
```
REVENUES (4):
- Revenue - Commision  ⚠️ (misspelled - matches your sheets)
- Revenue - Sales
- Revenue - Services
- Revenue - Rental Income

UTILITIES (3):
- EXP - Utilities - Gas
- EXP - Utilities - Water
- EXP - Utilities  - Electricity  ⚠️ (TWO spaces - matches your sheets)

... (33 total - all verified against your config files)
```

**Type of Payment (4 options):**
```
1. Bank Transfer - Bangkok Bank - Shaun Ducker
2. Bank Transfer - Bangkok Bank - Maria Ren
3. Bank transfer - Krung Thai Bank - Family Account  ⚠️ (lowercase "transfer")
4. Cash
```

**Important:** The mobile app preserves:
- ✅ Misspellings (e.g., "Commision")
- ✅ Double spaces (e.g., "Utilities  - Electricity")
- ✅ Case variations (e.g., "Transfer" vs "transfer")

This ensures 100% compatibility with your Google Sheets backend.

## 📊 API Usage Statistics

**Expected API Call Patterns:**

| Screen | API Calls | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Upload | 2 calls (OCR + Extract) | Per receipt upload |
| Manual Entry | 1 call (Submit) | Per transaction |
| Balance | 1 call (Get) | On load + refresh |
| P&L | 1 call (Get) | On load + refresh |
| Inbox | 1-2 calls (Get + Delete) | On load + refresh + delete |

**Caching:**
- Mobile app does NOT cache API responses yet
- Every screen load = fresh API call
- Pull-to-refresh = new API call
- Offline support planned for Phase 3

---

## 🔒 Security & Authentication

**Current Implementation:**
- No authentication headers required (as per API docs)
- All requests to `https://accounting-buddy-app.vercel.app`
- HTTPS only
- No API keys needed

**Future Considerations:**
- If you add authentication, we'll need:
  - Auth token format
  - Token refresh mechanism
  - Login/logout endpoints

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Backend Configuration

Some API endpoints return "not configured" errors:
```json
{
  "error": "P&L endpoint not configured. Please set SHEETS_PNL_URL environment variable."
}
```

**Affected endpoints:**
- `/api/pnl` - Needs `SHEETS_PNL_URL`
- `/api/balance/get` - Needs `SHEETS_BALANCES_GET_URL`
- `/api/inbox` - Needs `SHEETS_INBOX_URL`

**Mobile app behavior:**
- ✅ Handles these errors gracefully
- ✅ Shows user-friendly message
- ✅ Doesn't crash
- ✅ Ready to work when you configure the env vars

**Action needed:** Set environment variables on Vercel

---

### Rate Limiting

**Question for webapp team:**
- Do you have rate limiting on the APIs?
- If yes, what are the limits?
- Should we implement request throttling on mobile?

Currently, the mobile app can make rapid requests (e.g., multiple uploads in quick succession).

## 🤝 What We Need From You

### 1. **Environment Variables** (High Priority)

Please configure these on Vercel:
```
SHEETS_PNL_URL=<your_google_sheets_pnl_url>
SHEETS_BALANCES_GET_URL=<your_balances_url>
SHEETS_BALANCES_APPEND_URL=<your_balances_append_url>
SHEETS_INBOX_URL=<your_inbox_url>
```

This will enable P&L, Balance, and Inbox features.

- API endpoints
- Request/response formats
