{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```

**HTTP Status:** 500  
**Response Time:** 9.41 seconds  
**Result:** ‚ùå STILL FAILING

---

## üîç **Analysis**

### **Current Situation:**

All endpoints are still returning "Unauthorized" errors, which means:

1. ‚ùå The Google Apps Script secret might not be updated yet
2. ‚ùå OR the Apps Script hasn't been redeployed with the new secret
3. ‚ùå OR the Apps Script deployment URL has changed
4. ‚ùå OR there's a caching issue with Vercel

---

## ‚ùì **Questions for PM & Webapp Team**

### **For PM:**

**Question 1:** Did you update the Google Apps Script secret?
- If yes, did you save the changes?
- Did you redeploy the Apps Script?

**Question 2:** Can you test the Apps Script webhook directly?
```bash
curl -X POST "YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_DEPLOYMENT_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "getPnL",
    "secret": "VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8="
  }'
```

**Question 3:** What response do you get from the direct test?
- If you get data ‚Üí Apps Script is working, issue is with Vercel
- If you get "Unauthorized" ‚Üí Apps Script secret still doesn't match

---

### **For Webapp Team:**

**Question 1:** Did you trigger a new Vercel deployment after PM fixed Apps Script?
- Vercel might be caching the old responses
- Try triggering a new deployment

**Question 2:** Can you check the Vercel logs?
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Check the function logs for `/api/pnl`
- See what error is being returned

**Question 3:** Is the `SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL` correct in Vercel?
- Verify it points to the correct Apps Script deployment
- Verify the deployment URL hasn't changed

---

## üîß **Possible Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Verify Apps Script Secret (PM)**

1. Open Google Apps Script: https://script.google.com
2. Open "Accounting Buddy Webhook" project
3. Check the code for this line:
   ```javascript
   const EXPECTED_SECRET = "VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8=";
   ```
4. Verify it matches exactly (no extra spaces, quotes, etc.)
5. Save and deploy a new version

---

### **Solution 2: Redeploy Apps Script (PM)**

1. In Google Apps Script, click **Deploy** ‚Üí **Manage deployments**
2. Click **Edit** (pencil icon) on the existing deployment
3. Click **New version**
4. Description: "V8 - Fixed webhook secret"
5. Click **Deploy**
6. Test the deployment URL directly with cURL

---

### **Solution 3: Trigger New Vercel Deployment (Webapp Team)**

1. Make a small change to any file (e.g., add a comment)
2. Commit and push to main branch
3. Wait for Vercel to redeploy (2-3 minutes)
4. Test endpoints again

OR use Vercel CLI:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

---

### **Solution 4: Check Vercel Environment Variables (Webapp Team)**

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Verify `SHEETS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` = `VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8=`
4. Verify `SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL` points to correct Apps Script deployment
5. If changed, trigger new deployment

## üö® **Current Blocker**

**Issue:** All Apps Script endpoints still returning "Unauthorized"  
**Impact:** Cannot proceed with testing  
**Owner:** PM + Webapp Team  
**Action Required:** Debug and fix Apps Script authentication  

---

## üí° **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **PM:** Test Apps Script webhook directly with cURL
   - This will confirm if Apps Script is working
   - If it works ‚Üí Issue is with Vercel
   - If it fails ‚Üí Issue is with Apps Script

2. **Webapp Team:** Check Vercel function logs
   - See what error is being logged
   - Verify environment variables are loaded
   - Verify webhook URL is correct

3. **Both:** Join a quick debugging session
   - Screen share to diagnose together
   - Test step by step
   - Fix the issue collaboratively

---

## üìû **Communication**

### **Mobile Team Status:**

**We've Done:**
- ‚úÖ Re-tested all endpoints after PM said issue was resolved
- ‚úÖ Documented test results
- ‚úÖ Identified that issue still persists
- ‚úÖ Provided debugging checklist

**We're Waiting For:**
- ‚è≥ PM to verify Apps Script secret is correct
- ‚è≥ PM to test Apps Script directly
- ‚è≥ Webapp team to verify Vercel configuration
- ‚è≥ Webapp team to trigger new deployment
- ‚è≥ Confirmation that endpoints are working

**We're Ready To:**
- ‚úÖ Re-test immediately after fix
- ‚úÖ Continue with Phase 2 and 3 testing
- ‚úÖ Provide final integration report

---

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

**Endpoints are working when:**

1. ‚úÖ `GET /api/inbox` returns `{"ok":true,"data":[...]}`
2. ‚úÖ `GET /api/pnl` returns `{"ok":true,"data":{...}}`
3. ‚úÖ `GET /api/balance/get` returns `{"balances":[...]}`
4. ‚úÖ `POST /api/balance/save` returns `{"ok":true}`
5. ‚úÖ HTTP status is 200 (not 500)
6. ‚úÖ Response time is < 10 seconds
7. ‚úÖ No "Unauthorized" errors

---

## üìã **Next Steps**

### **For PM (URGENT):**

1. Test Apps Script webhook directly:
```bash
curl -X POST "YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"getPnL","secret":"VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8="}'
```

2. Share the result with webapp team and mobile team

3. If it fails:
   - Update Apps Script secret
   - Redeploy Apps Script
   - Test again

---

### **For Webapp Team:**

1. Check Vercel function logs for `/api/pnl`
2. Verify `SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL` and `SHEETS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel
3. Trigger new Vercel deployment
4. Test endpoints from Vercel dashboard
5. Share results with mobile team

---

### **For Mobile Team:**

1. ‚è≥ Wait for PM and webapp team to debug
2. ‚è≥ Re-test when notified
3. ‚è≥ Continue with Phase 2 and 3 if tests pass

---

## üîç **Additional Information**

### **Apps Script File Check:**

We verified the Apps Script file in the webapp repo:

**File:** `COMPLETE_APPS_SCRIPT_V7_WITH_BALANCE.js`  
**Line 38:** `const EXPECTED_SECRET = "VqwvzpO3Ja5Yn+qhWg6DLwTspv/t2V8f3CXI+iJ9Dz8=";`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Secret is correct in the file

**This means:**
- The file has the correct secret
- BUT the deployed Apps Script might have a different version
- PM needs to redeploy the latest version

---

## ‚úÖ **Summary**

**Test Status:** ‚ùå All Apps Script endpoints still failing  
**Error:** "Unauthorized" (same as before)  
**Root Cause:** Apps Script secret mismatch (not resolved yet)  
**Action Required:** PM needs to redeploy Apps Script with correct secret  
**ETA:** Unknown - waiting for PM and webapp team  

---

**Mobile App Team**  
**Status:** ‚è≥ Waiting for Apps Script fix  
**Tests Completed:** 4 out of 8 endpoints tested (all failed)  
**Next Action:** Re-test after PM redeploys Apps Script  
**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025 - 10:00 PM
