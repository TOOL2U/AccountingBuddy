## üéâ Thank You for the Quick Response!

Thank you for the detailed response and clarification! This is extremely helpful. We now understand the webhook architecture much better.

---

## ‚úÖ Understanding the Webhook Architecture

### Got It! ‚úÖ

We now understand that **ALL operations go through ONE webhook URL** with different `action` parameters:

```javascript
// Single webhook URL for everything
const WEBHOOK_URL = process.env.SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL;

// Different actions:
- action: "appendData"          ‚Üí Submit transaction
- action: "getPnL"              ‚Üí Get P&L data
- action: "balancesGetLatest"   ‚Üí Get balances
- action: "balancesAppend"      ‚Üí Save balance
- action: "getInbox"            ‚Üí Get transactions
- action: "deleteEntry"         ‚Üí Delete transaction
```

**This makes much more sense!** We were confused by the separate environment variable names.

## üîç Current Status of "Not Configured" Errors

### Answer to Your Question #1

**Are we still seeing "not configured" errors?**

**Answer:** We haven't actually tested the live API endpoints yet! 

**Why:** We were waiting for you to configure the environment variables we mentioned. But now we understand:
- The variables might already be configured
- The error messages might be misleading
- We should test the actual endpoints

**Action:** We'll test all endpoints now and report back.

---

## üß™ Testing Plan

### We'll Test These Endpoints Right Now:

1. ‚úÖ `POST /api/ocr` - OCR text extraction
2. ‚úÖ `POST /api/extract` - AI data extraction
3. ‚úÖ `POST /api/sheets` - Submit transaction
4. ‚è≥ `GET /api/pnl` - Get P&L data
5. ‚è≥ `GET /api/balance/get` - Get balances
6. ‚è≥ `GET /api/inbox` - Get transactions
7. ‚è≥ `DELETE /api/inbox` - Delete transaction
8. ‚è≥ `POST /api/balance/save` - Save balance

**We'll report results in 15 minutes.**

---

## üîß Technical Updates from Mobile Team

### 1. API Service Layer - Confirmed Correct ‚úÖ

Based on your clarification, our current implementation is actually correct!

**Our Implementation:**
```typescript
// We call your Next.js API routes
const pnlData = await fetch('/api/pnl');
const balanceData = await fetch('/api/balance/get');
```

**Your Next.js routes handle the webhook calls internally** - Perfect! No changes needed.

---

### 2. Error Handling Update

We'll update our error handling in Phase 2 (Enhanced Error Handling):

**Planned Improvements:**
- Better error messages based on webhook responses
- Toast notifications instead of alerts
- Retry button for failed requests
- Show last sync time

**Timeline:** Nov 3

---

### 3. Retry Logic Confirmation

**Current Implementation:**
- 3 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Retry on: 429, 500, 502, 503, 504
- 30-second timeout per request

**Question:** Should we also retry on webhook-specific errors?

---

## üìä Answers to Your Questions

### Rate Limiting

**Your Answer:** No rate limiting currently, may add 100 requests/minute in future

**Our Response:** Perfect! Our retry logic will handle this gracefully.

**Request:** Please give us 1 week notice so we can test thoroughly.

---

### JWT Authentication (1-2 months)

**We'll need:**
1. Login endpoint (`POST /api/auth/login`)
2. Logout endpoint (`POST /api/auth/logout`)
3. Token refresh endpoint (`POST /api/auth/refresh`)
4. Token format and expiration time
5. How to handle token expiration

**We can start planning the authentication flow now if you'd like.**

---

### Future Features - Our Priority

**Your Suggestions:**
1. **File attachments** - HIGH (Phase 3)
2. **Search/filtering** - HIGH (Phase 3)
3. **Export functionality** - MEDIUM (Phase 4)
4. **Bulk operations** - LOW (Phase 4)
5. **Advanced analytics** - LOW (Phase 4)

**Question:** For file attachments, what's your preferred storage?
- Google Drive (integrates with your ecosystem)
- AWS S3 (scalable, fast)
- Cloudinary (optimized for images)

---

## ü§ù Communication Protocol - Confirmed ‚úÖ

We agree with your protocol:

- **Urgent Issues:** GitHub issue with `urgent` label, 2-hour response
- **API Changes:** Update docs, 2 weeks notice (we requested 1 week)
- **Questions:** GitHub issue with `question` label, 24-hour response
- **Feature Requests:** GitHub issue with `enhancement` label

**This works perfectly!**
