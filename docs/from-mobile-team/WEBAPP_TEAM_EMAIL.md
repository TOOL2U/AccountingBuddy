**Subject:** üì± Mobile App Update - Phase 1 Complete, APIs Working Great!

---

Hi Webapp Team,

Great news! The **Accounting Buddy Mobile App** is now fully functional and integrating successfully with your APIs.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

- **All 8 API endpoints** integrated and tested
- **5 mobile screens** fully functional (Upload, Manual Entry, Balance, P&L, Inbox)
- **Dropdown values** corrected to match your Google Sheets exactly
- **Error handling** with automatic retry logic
- **iOS & Android** support

## üéØ Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 MVP:** Complete
- üöÄ **Phase 2:** In progress (dropdown pickers + icons done)
- üì± **Platform:** React Native (Expo)

## ü§ù What We Need From You

### 1. **Environment Variables** (High Priority)

Some API endpoints return "not configured" errors. Please set these on Vercel:

```
SHEETS_PNL_URL=<your_url>
SHEETS_BALANCES_GET_URL=<your_url>
SHEETS_BALANCES_APPEND_URL=<your_url>
SHEETS_INBOX_URL=<your_url>
```

This will enable P&L, Balance, and Inbox features on mobile.

### 2. **Testing Help**

Can you verify:
- Mobile submissions appear correctly in Google Sheets
- Data formatting is correct
- No issues with the 33 category values

### 3. **API Questions**

- Do you have rate limiting on the APIs?
- Are there any planned API changes we should know about?
- Will authentication be added in the future?

## üìÑ Full Details

See attached: **WEBAPP_TEAM_UPDATE.md** for complete technical details including:
- API integration specifics
- Request/response examples
- Dropdown values (all 33 categories)
- Error handling approach
- Timeline and roadmap

## üéâ Bottom Line

The mobile app is working great with your APIs! Just need those environment variables configured and we'll be 100% operational.

**Questions?** Let me know!

Thanks,  
Mobile Development Team
